1. WHAT ARE YOUR MOTIVATIONS TOWARDS BIOINFORMATICS?

Bioinformatics makes months work in days. It is already dealing with the process of molecular docking and identification of drugs for which the traditional approach would have taken almost a century to come up with potential lead compounds. 

With little bit more advancements and introduction of artificial intelligence approaches Bioinformatics could one day easily replace wet lab techniques and promotes towards automation.








2. WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO GAIN FROM THIS ASSOCIATION?

I would preferabbly want to learn R and Python programming which are important to deal with many BioSoftwares and statistical analysis.

NGS data analytics

And some every day bioinformatics questions which I face while using a software.
